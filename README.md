# Robot Birds
You've all heard about Angry birds, Flappy birds and all the others, but you've never heard of Robot birds!

## What is it
In Robot birds you take on the role of a wild west nutter with a garage-load of guns. When robot birds start to land in your back garden, well the only sensible course of action is to pull our your arsenal and start firing.
